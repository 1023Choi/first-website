          Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published
          by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve
          Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy
          #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been
          featured in movies, television shows, video games, and plays.
          Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt
          May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
          Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal
          with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him
          many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson
          and Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson and
          the Black Cat, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and
          Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a
          bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces,
          superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his
          "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices
          that shoot artificial spider webs of his own design.
