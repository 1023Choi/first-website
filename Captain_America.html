          Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books
          published by Marvel Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack
          Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1
          (cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel
          Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who
          often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics'
          most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of
          superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America comic
          book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953.
          Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has
          remained in publication.

          Margaret Carter, more commonly known as Peggy Carter, is a fictional
          character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise
          portrayed by Hayley Atwell, based on the character of the same name
          from Marvel Comics. Carter is depicted as a British MI6 agent and
          member of the Strategic Scientific Reserve who became the love
          interest of Steve Rogers during World War II. Following the war, she
          goes on to become one of the founders of S.H.I.E.L.D., eventually
          serving as the Director. Atwell has received critical praise for her
          depiction of the character.
